## What Have I Done:
I've made this notes app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've used marked-1.2.2.js for made this project. I've also used the CDN of font-awesome 5.15.4 from CDNJS for use the icons.

Marked js is a low-level markdown compiler for parsing markdown without caching or blocking for long periods of time. It is available as a command line interface and running in client-side or server-side JavaScript projects.

A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

Font Awesome is a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and Less. As of 2020, Font Awesome was used by 38% of sites that use third-party font scripts, placing Font Awesome in second place after Google Fonts.
